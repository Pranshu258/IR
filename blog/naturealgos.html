                        Nature is known to be the best optimizer. Natural processes most often than not reach an
                        optimal equilibrium. Scientists have always strived to understand and model such processes.
                        Thus, many algorithms exist today that are inspired by nature. Many of these algorithms
                        and heuristics can be used to solve problems for which no polynomial time algorithms exist,
                        such as Job Shop Scheduling and many other Combinatorial Optimization problems. We will
                        discuss some of these algorithms and heuristics and how they help us solve complex problems
                        of practical importance. We will focus mainly on Ant Colony Optimization, Particle Swarm
                        Optimization, Simulated Annealing and Evolutionary Algorithms.

                            A heuristic can be thought of as a rule of thumb that will hopefully nd a good solution for a given problem. These techniques are mainly applied to complex convex multivariate
                            constrained combinatorial optimization problems which are usually NP complete or harder.

                            A metaheuristic is a higher-level procedure or heuristic designed to nd, generate,

                            especially with incomplete or imperfect information or limited computation capacity." [Bianchi
                            et al. (2009)]

                        Ant Colony Optimization utilizes a family of heuristics inspired by the foraging behavior of
                        Ants. Ants are highly co-operative social insects, they search for food in huge groups and com-
                        municate indirectly using a chemical called pheromone. These heuristics model individual ants
                        as independent solution nders roaming in the solution space of a problem and communicating
                        via a shared variable(s) i.e. the pheromone.

                        When a liquid is cooled slowly, its particles arrange themselves in some conguration that
                        allows minimum energy state - this process is called annealing. Simulated Annealing tries to
                        model this phenomenon by drawing an analogy between between the behavior of multi-body
                        systems (e.g. liquids) in thermal equilibrium at a nite temperature and the behaviour of the
                        objective function of a combinatorial optimization problem at different values of the variables
                        involved. [Kirkpatrick et al. (1983)]

                    <p>
                        Particle Swarm Optimization is a another optimization heuristic. It relies on a swarm of
                        particles that are initialized with some conguration in the solution space of a given prob-
                        lem. These particles then explore the solution space individually while communicating with
                        other particles around them to nd the best solution. After some iterations these particles
                        are expected to make swarms around optimal solution(s). PSO relies on randomization in the
                        movement of particles to avoid getting stuck in local optima.

                        Evolutionary Algorithms are a family of algorithms inspired from Neo-Darwinism paradigm
                        of biological evolution.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        These algorithms model solutions as individual species with their genetic code representing
                        the solution itself. These individuals later reproduce to create new individuals with different
                        genetic code. Reproduction involves choosing healthy parents and then crossing over their genes
                        to create an offspring. The optimality of the solution instance represented by the genetic code
                        of the offspring determines its tness. Then the notion of "survival of the ttest" comes into
                        play. The best individuals survive and then they reproduce for the next generational cycle.
                        Thus, this model utilizes both exploration and exploitation of the solution space.
                        Genetic Algorithms, Evolutionary Strategies, Differential Evolution etc., are a few variants
                        of EAs.

                        Ant Algorithms are a family of algorithms inspired by the behavior of real ant colonies. Ants
                        are social insects and they always work together to ensure the survival of the colony as a whole.
                        When in search of food, ants deposit a chemical substance called pheromone on their path. If
                        they succeed in nding a food source they again deposit pheromone on their path back to the
                        colony. The amount of pheromone they deposit on the path often is determined by the quality
                        and quantity of the food source that the path leads to. Also, if the multiple ants nd the same
                        food source, the one which followed the shorter path will deposit the pheromone rst. When
                        looking for food the ants also consider the pheromone deposited by other ants to aid their own
                        search. Thus, the shorter paths and the paths which lead to better food sources will be followed
                        by more and more ants and the pheromone on them will be further enriched (positive feedback
                        in search). Also, because pheromone evaporates in atmosphere with the passage of time, paths
                        which are no longer useful or followed will lose the pheromone deposited on them. However,
                        ants are always free to choose their own paths ensuring the explore for new food sources as well
                        instead of just clinging upon only one.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This behavior of ants can be utilized to design algorithms to solve search and optimization
                        problems. [Dorigo et al. (1999)] were the first to model foraging behavior of ant colonies and
                        design a metaheuristic that can be used to solve problems of practical importance.
