							Hi<br>
							<b>How do you do?  What brings you to see me?</b><br>
							I wanted to talk to you.<br>
							<b>Why do you say you wanted to talk to me?</b><br>
							Because I am feeling bad.<br>
							<b>Is it because you are feeling bad that you came to me?</b><br>
							Yes, can you fix me.<br>
							<b>Earlier you said you are feeling bad?</b><br>
							Can you fix me is the question<br>
							<b>Maybe your life has something to do with this.</b><br>
							Yes, I feel have a huge workload, may be that is the reason<br>
							<b>Does it bother you that is the reason?</b><br>
							No, I must do the work<br>
							<b>Is it because of your plans that you say you must do the work?</b><br>
							Yes, but I don't think that they are working<br>
							<b>When did you first know that you do not think that they are working?</b><br>
							I came to know that last month<br>
							<b>Can you elaborate on that?</b><br>
							Well, I was unable to finish the work before dedline<br>
							<b>Perhaps the people you hang around with have something to do with</b>
							this.<br>
							I think so, some of them are quite disturbing<br>
							<b>What makes you believe you think so some them are quite disturbing?</b><br>
							Because, they are dirtbags<br>
							<b>Does the fact that they are dirtbags explain anything else?</b><br>
							No, I think I need some rest, I shoul go now<br>
							<b>I don't understand.</b><br>
							Bye, talk to you later<br>
							<b>My secretary will send you a bill.</b><br>
							Ok, thanks

							Hi<br>
							<b>How do you do?  What brings you to see me?</b><br>
							I just wanted to talk to you<br>
							<b>Why do you say you just wanted to talk to me?</b><br>
							Because I am sick<br>
							<b>Is it because you are sick that you came to me?</b><br>
							Yes<br>
							<b>I see...  Well, what makes you believe this is so?</b><br>
							Because you are a doctor<br>
							<b>Does it bother you that I am a doctor?</b><br>
							NO<br>
							<b>Why not?</b><br>
							I think you are mad<br>
							<b>Are you mad often?</b><br>
							I am not mad, you are mad<br>
							<b>What causes you to be mad?</b><br>
							You are stupid<br>
							<b>Earlier you said you are sick?</b><br>
							Good bye<br>
							<b>My secretary will send you a bill.</b><br>
							I won't pay<br>

							So, as we can see, there are many possibilities where the conversation can go wrong. This was one example.<br>
							There are huge possibilities of improvement here.
